Automated Resume Screening System: Enhancing Recruitment Efficiency

In our resume shortlisting project, we designed a system to streamline the recruitment process by automatically evaluating resumes against job descriptions (JDs). Using Flask for backend development and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend design, we created an intuitive interface where users could upload resumes and JDs. We trained a Machine Learning model to identify relevant keywords in the JDs and compare them with the content of resumes. Based on this comparison, each resume received a score reflecting its relevance to the job. The top resumes, along with their corresponding scores, were then displayed to recruiters, simplifying the screening process and saving valuable time.
